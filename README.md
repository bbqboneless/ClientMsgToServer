# Assignment6
Client-Server

For this assignment, we were asked to do a program where the client would send a message to the server and the server would receive it. Those were simple tasks, very interesting in fact. As for the 1st excercise (client.c), we would type the message and get it back from the server (in this case the Lab's VPN). In the 2nd excercise (client2.c), we would give the file as an argument, and then type a message, that would be written in the final file, as it can be seen in the PDF file. We typed strings of as, bs and cs, and those would be written in the file.
